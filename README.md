# hello-world
This is my first repository! 
In an effort to take on the persona of lizbeth salander...here I am, trying to learn computers and similar hackerly type stuff. I'm already a coffee addict, so I have that going for me. Except at the moment I'm drinking earl grey, trying to feel like cpt. picard.
